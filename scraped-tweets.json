New QB just after the T. Black injury, no spring game, on the road, worst half of football with penalties, and still a chance to win on the last drive. Would be a different game today."}

I don't see Bama, Georgia, Clemson, USC, Notre Dame or Texas with numerous uniforms. But, hope the players enjoy it."}
