I think a black hole would open up and destroy us all. LOL!"

Alabama, Clemson, Notre Dame, etc...would kill us. If we COULD compete with them we would've destroyed Wisconsin."

New QB just after the T. Black injury, no spring game, on the road, worst half of football with penalties, and still a chance to win on the last drive. Would be a different game today."

I don't see Bama, Georgia, Clemson, USC, Notre Dame or Texas with numerous uniforms. But, hope the players enjoy it."
